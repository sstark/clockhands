# Clockhands
Classic clock with hands, rendered in the terminal

Depending on what terminal font you are using, you might want to
adjust `whRatio` in main.go. The less 'quadratic' your glyphs are,
the higher the value should be normally.

This is meant to be run in a terminal capable of displaying 256
colors.

Press ESC to exit.
